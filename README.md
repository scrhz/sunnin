# sunnin

A CLI app that retrieves & prints a list of sunrise & sunset times for 100 random coordinates and identifies the point of earliest sunrise out of this list.

## Requirements:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) & [node](https://nodejs.org/)
- This project was developed using Node v18.
- [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) from npm or [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) are good candidates for managing multiple node versions.

## Building:

1. Make sure you have node and npm installed and in your PATH.
2. Clone the repository and run `npm install` from the repo root directory.
3. Run `npm run run` to run the main app script and output 100 random sunset times, followed by the earliest time.
4. Run `npm run test` to run tests.
